Feature: Generate proper Python code
    In order to be able to transform and recreate Python modules,
    as a software developer,
    I want the ASTFormatter class to be able to generate proper
    Python code for any given AST tree.

    @v2.6 @v2.7 @v3.4
    Scenario Outline: AST structures common to 2.x and 3.x should work.
        Given I have parsed an AST tree from "<source input>",
         when I transform the AST tree to source,
         then the output should include "<output snippet>".

    Examples:
        | source input                                          | output snippet                                            |
        | def foo(x): pass                                      | def foo(x):\n    pass                                     |
        | class foo(object): pass                               | class foo(object):                                        |
        | return x                                              | return x                                                  |
        | del foo[0]                                            | del foo[0]                                                |
        | foo = x                                               | foo = x                                                   |
        | foo += y                                              | foo += y                                                  |

    Scenario Outline: AST structures in 2.6+ should work.
        Given I have parsed an AST tree from "<source input>",
         when I transform the AST tree to source,
         then the output should include "<output snippet>".

    Examples:
        | source input                                          | output snippet                                            |
        | print >> foo, x,                                      | print >> foo, x,                                          |
        | raise foo,x                                           | raise foo,x                                               |
        | try:\n  pass\nexcept foo,x:\n  pass\nelse:\n  pass    | try:\n    pass\nexcept foo,x:\n    pass\nelse:\n    pass  |
        | exec "foo" in x,y                                     | exec 'foo' in x, y                                        |
        | x <> y                                                | x != y                                                    |
        | `foo`                                                 | `foo`                                                     |

    Scenario Outline: AST structures in 2.7+ and 3.4+ should work.
        Given I have parsed an AST tree from "<source input>",
